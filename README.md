# 🧩 Go-Reloaded

A text transformation and formatting tool written in **Go**.  
It reads an input file, applies multiple linguistic and formatting rules,  
and produces an **exactly formatted output** file.

---

## 🚀 Overview

`go-reloaded` performs automated text editing and correction based on  
directives and context rules. It reads an input file (e.g., `sample.txt`)  
and produces a corrected output file (`result.txt`).

## 🏃‍♂️ Run

To run the program on any text file:

```bash
go run ./cmd/go-reloaded input.txt output.txt

### Example Usage

```bash
go run ./cmd/go-reloaded ./sample.txt ./result.txt
```

**Input (`sample.txt`):**
```
harold wilson (cap, 2) : ' I am a optimist ,but a optimist who carries a raincoat . '.
```

**Output (`result.txt`):**
```
Harold Wilson: 'I am an optimist, but an optimist who carries a raincoat.'
```

## 🧠 Core Transformation Rules

| Rule | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `(hex)` | Converts preceding hexadecimal to decimal | `1E (hex)` → `30` |
| `(bin)` | Converts preceding binary to decimal | `10 (bin)` → `2` |
| `(up)` | Uppercases the previous word | `go (up)` → `GO` |
| `(low)` | Lowercases the previous word | `GO (low)` → `go` |
| `(cap)` | Capitalizes the previous word | `bridge (cap)` → `Bridge` |
| `(up, N)` / `(low, N)` / `(cap, N)` | Applies case rule to previous *N* words | `so exciting (up, 2)` → `SO EXCITING` |
| Punctuation | Ensures correct spacing around `. , ! ? : ;` | `Hello ,world !` → `Hello, world!` |
| Quotes `'` | Trims spaces inside quotes | `' awesome '` → `'awesome'` |
| Articles | Converts `a` → `an` before vowels or `h` | `a owl` → `an owl` |

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Pipeline Flow

```
Input → [Tokenize] → [Numbers] → [Casing] → [Articles] → [Format] → Output
```

Each stage is modular, testable, and independent:
- **tokenize.go** – splits and normalizes tokens  
- **numbers.go** – handles `(hex)` and `(bin)` conversions  
- **casing.go** – processes `(up)`, `(low)`, `(cap)` directives  
- **articles.go** – corrects “a” → “an”  
- **format.go** – cleans punctuation and quote spacing  
- **pipeline.go** – orchestrates all stages  
- **types.go** – defines token structures and enums

# Golden Tests

This folder contains all input/output pairs used for final validation.

Each test follows the format:
- `exNN.input.txt` → original text
- `exNN.expected.txt` → expected output
- `exNN.result.txt` → produced by running the program

Run comparison:
```bash
go run ./cmd/go-reloaded tests/golden/exNN.input.txt tests/golden/exNN.result.txt
diff -u tests/golden/exNN.result.txt tests/golden/exNN.expected.txt

## 🧪 Golden Test Reference

For detailed examples of all input/output pairs used in validation,  
see the full list in [`tests/golden/Golden Tests.md`](./tests/golden/Golden%20Tests.md).

This file documents:
- All transformation types (numbers, casing, punctuation, articles)
- Edge cases and combined directives
- Expected outputs for auditor verification

## 🧪 Running Tests

You can manually test the tool using sample files:

```bash
echo "I have to pack 101 (bin) outfits. Packed 1a (hex) just to be sure." > sample.txt
go run ./cmd/go-reloaded sample.txt result.txt
cat result.txt
```

Expected output:
```
I have to pack 5 outfits. Packed 26 just to be sure.
```
